Susanne's Portfolio

# Description

This project is showcasing the skills that I have learnt todate; HTML, CSS, Bulma CSS, Javascript, WEB APIs and Node.  I enjoy solving problems and am passionate about History.  I want to develop my internet and web skills so that I can become a resource for local Historical Societies to use to help them get their collections online.  This particular project shows my first work, a project using an OpenWeather API and a project that I worked on as part of a team.
